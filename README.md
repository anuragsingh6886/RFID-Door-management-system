# RFID-Door-management-system

It is made to make our lives easier and technological by using RFID card.

RFID-based control system design is based on microcontroller control
system which by using Arduino UNO that works with ATmega328P microchip,
the RFID module used is the MFRC522RFID module which is a reliable and
compatible component to work with Arduino's boards, for door control a
28BJY-48 Stepper Motor is used.
